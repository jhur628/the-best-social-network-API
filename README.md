## Installation
Ensure you have all libraries installed with "npm i"

Run the application with "npm start"

## Usage
This backend can be used via an API testing tool, such as: Insomnia or Postman.

Using different routes, users can view, create, update, and delete different documents from MongoDB.

When the user uses "/users" routes, the user can create a user, view all or a single user, update a user's information, or delete a user. The user also has the ability to add and delete a friend to the user.

When the user uses "/thoughts" routes, the user can create a thought, view all or a single thought, update a thought, or delete a thought. The user also has the ability to add and delete a reaction to a thought.

Please refer to the linked video for a walkthrough of the application.
